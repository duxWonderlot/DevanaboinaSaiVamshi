Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Code that i am Proud of written in java
 private Body createbody1(float x , float y , float width, float height, boolean isStatic , World world){


        //------------crate------//

        if (isStatic)
            bodyDef.type = BodyDef.BodyType.StaticBody;
        else
            bodyDef.type = BodyDef.BodyType.DynamicBody;
        bodyDef.position.set(x / PPM, y / PPM);
        //.fixedRotation = true;


        PolygonShape shape = new PolygonShape();
        shape.setAsBox(width / 2 / PPM, height / 2 / PPM);          // taking bodies position
        fixtureDef.shape = shape;
        fixtureDef.friction = 0.5f;
        fixtureDef.restitution = 0.0f;
        fixtureDef.density = 0.0f;

        this.body = world.createBody(bodyDef);
        this.body.createFixture(fixtureDef).setUserData(this);



        return body;
